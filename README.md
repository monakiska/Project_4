The goal of this project was to analyze average payrolls and prices in the Czech Republic over a certain period and to explore correlation between them. 

The project is divided into two main parts. Firstly, it was necessary to create tables containing the available data. Secondly, the data was analyzed by answering specific research questions. Both the tables and the answers to the research questions are provided as SQL scripts. In addition, an interpretation of the results is included in the cover letter.

Notes:  
I decided to work only with the recalculated number of full-time employees, as it seems more relevant.  
Most of the analysis use data from the created tables. However, the original data are also used in some cases to expand the range of analyzed years where appropriate.
